step 1 create azure-pipelines.yml file to create the pipe line 
(Go to repo and select file and creae New FIle) and created on empty file
step 2 commit in to main branch

in the file

        triggers:
            -main
         pool
            vmImage: 'ubonto-latest'
        stage:
        - stage: builApp
            jobs:
            - jobs: BuildPushImage
            steps:
            --settings--
            -tasks: Docker@2
            inputs:
                ContainerRegistry: 'ACR Demo',
                repository: '',
                command: 'buidAndPush'
                DockerFile: '.DockerFile'
                tags: '${Build.BuildId}'

step 3 (configure): in edit of azure-pipelines.yml file we have right side tasks for add the the tools 
for(ex: docker, Ant) we have to sleect docker and can select the command buildAndPush from drop down
 of command

step 4 go to cproject configure and select the service like azure or ec2 ar any other

steps 5 : save the yml file and we can see the stages of pipeline automatically created

step 6 we can create the different satges like DelpoyDev Deploytest DeployProd
